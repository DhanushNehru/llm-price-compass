# Security Policy

Thank you for helping keep this project secure. This document explains how to report security vulnerabilities and how the maintainers will respond.

## Reporting a Vulnerability (Preferred)
- Use GitHub Security Advisories for a private report when possible.
- If you cannot use GitHub Security Advisories, send a confidential report to the maintainers via email: security@llm-price-compass.example (replace with the appropriate maintainer contact if available).

When reporting, please include:
- A clear summary of the issue.
- Affected repository path and commit/tag or branch.
- Step-by-step reproduction instructions and proof-of-concept (if possible).
- Impact and potential mitigations.
- Any relevant logs, payloads, or screenshots.
- Your contact information and preferred disclosure timeline.

Do NOT include exploit code in public issues or pull requests.

## Response Process
- Acknowledgement: maintainers will acknowledge reports within 3 business days.
- Triage: we will assess severity and prioritize work.
- Coordination: we will coordinate fixes and a disclosure timeline with the reporter.
- Fixes will be released via a patched commit and tagged release; security advisories will be used to publish details when appropriate.

## Supported Versions
- Security fixes will be applied to supported branches and released tags. If specific version support is relevant, it will be noted in advisories.

## Disclosure Policy
- Please do not publicly disclose vulnerabilities until a fix or mitigation is available and coordinated with the maintainers.
- If you intend to disclose publicly, contact us first to coordinate timelines.

## Credit and Recognition
- Reporters who responsibly disclose issues may be credited in release notes or a SECURITY.md acknowledgement, unless they request anonymity.

## Legal
- Report security issues in good faith. Avoid actions that could harm users or systems beyond reproduction necessary to demonstrate the issue.

Thank you for helping to keep this project safe.
