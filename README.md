This project aims to collect benchmark data from different GPUs on various clouds/providers and compare it to fixed per token costs from other providers. By utilizing our platform, you can make informed decisions on cost-effective LLM options, affordable language models, and efficient LLM GPU selections.

Our comprehensive **LLM Price Comparison** tool empowers users to evaluate multiple AI models and provides insights into AI model pricing guides. This project will help you choose the right GPU and cloud provider for the model of your choiceâ€”facilitating GPU inference and LLM GPU benchmarks.
